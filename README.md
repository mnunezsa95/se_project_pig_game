### Intro - About the project

The online game known as "Pig Game" enables two users to play on the same computer. In this game, players take turns rolling the dice with the goal of reaching a score of 100. Points are accumulated for each successful roll, but if a player rolls a 1, they lose the points gathered in that round. To avoid this risk, players can choose to "hold," saving their current score and passing the turn to the other player. The game follows these rules:

1. Both players start with a score of 0.
2. Player 1 rolls the dice, accumulating points if they don't roll a 1. They can choose to roll again or "hold."
3. If Player 1 holds, their current score is added to their total, and it becomes Player 2's turn. If Player 1 rolls again without holding, points are accumulated as long as they avoid rolling a 1.
4. The first player to reach 100 points wins the game!

### Description of the Project

The structure of this project is created using HTML and CSS, while the functionality of the web app is implemented using vanilla JavaScript. The approach involves targeting and manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web app. This method was chosen due to the minimal manipulation required on the DOM.
